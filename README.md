# Chesapeake Harbour Pool Check-In System

This project was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to digitize the pool access process at Chesapeake Harbour. It replaced the manual paper-based sign-in system with a safer, more efficient solution using Google Workspace tools and a web interface.

## Overview

The system enabled:

- Unique household IDs for check-in tracking  
- Day-of reservations through a website  
- Staff-managed check-ins via iPads  
- Centralized data management using Google Sheets  

## Features

### Unique Household ID System  
Each household received a permanent ID, which staff used to check residents in and out of the pool.

### Online Reservation Form  
Residents could make same-day reservations through a simple website interface.

### Google Apps Script Integration  
- Automated ID generation  
- Form submission handling  
- Timestamped logging of reservations and check-ins  

### Staff Interface  
iPads were used by pool staff to check in residents based on ID, with all data logged in real time.

### Training and Documentation  
I wrote clear user instructions and trained staff on how to use the system daily.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Google Sites or custom HTML/CSS  
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script  
- **Data Management**: Google Sheets  
- **Devices**: iPads for on-site use  

## How It Worked

1. Residents submitted requests through a web form to register or reserve access.  
2. Apps Script handled data validation and logged it in Google Sheets.  
3. Staff used iPads to look up household IDs and confirm reservations.  
4. The system ensured accurate, contactless tracking of pool usage.  

## Impact

- Eliminated paper-based check-ins during COVID-19  
- Improved safety by minimizing contact  
- Enabled data-driven oversight of pool attendance  
- Scalable and transferable to similar residential settings
